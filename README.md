## April
親子丼 is a simple dish that is a small microcosm of everything good in Japanese cooking: dashi, soy sauce, sake, mirin, good quality rice with simple ingredients like egg and chicken.

Karaage is a Japanese fried chicken dish that is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The chicken is marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, sake, ginger, and garlic before being coated in potato starch and fried to perfection. The result is an irresistible dish that is bursting with flavor.

But that's not all - we also have two side dishes to accompany our Karaage recipe. First up is miso soup, a traditional Japanese soup made with miso paste, tofu, scallions, and seaweed. It's warm and comforting, and the perfect complement to the crispy Karaage.

Next, we have a refreshing and crunchy bean sprout salad with cucumber, soy sauce, and sesame oil. The combination of the crispness of the sprouts, the freshness of the cucumber, and the nuttiness of the sesame oil makes this a perfect side dish for the rich and flavorful Karaage.
